        <P>
          KaloWrite is intended for users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, you
          must not use the Service or create an account. If we learn we have collected personal data

          Users aged 13‚Äì17 may use free features (including the 500-word free allowance) but cannot
          purchase paid subscriptions or credits without verified parental consent. Parents or
          guardians must authorize purchases. We may request proof of consent before allowing
          transactions.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you believe a child under 13 has provided us information, contact{" "}
